## App Overview

I have created two tabs.\

1. `Search skills:` Here user can enter job name in the input (searched job name must be of at least 4 characters long).\
    An api will be called which will display suggestions in the dropdown. User can click on this suggestion and skills related with this selected job name will be displayed below in a table after succesful api response. If no data is found a message will be displayed stating please search something else. A cross button at the extreme right of the select input will help in clearing the searched input if you want to clear the input after anything from the dropdown is selected.

2. `Search Jobs`: Here user can enter job name in the input (searched skill name must be of at least 4 characters long).\
    An Api will be called which display suggestions in the dropdown. User can click on this suggestion and jobs related with this selected skill will be displayed below in a table after successful api response. If no data is found a message will be displayed stating please search something else. A cross button at the extreme right of the select input will help in clearing the searched input if you want to clear the input after anything from the dropdown is selected.
